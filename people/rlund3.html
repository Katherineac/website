          <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I'm basically awesome. I'll spare the technical mumbo jumbo and annoying lists of things for a short one proving my street cred:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I've worked on over 500 websites in my 3 years of real life on the job experience</li>
              <li>I can communicate with people... I can explain technical things to not-so-technical-speaking people without making them feel like an idiot</li>
              <li>I'm versatile. I'll do damn near anything at least once. Bring it on!</li>
              <li>If I don't know how to do something, which is rare, I probably know someone who does. If all else fails, I know how to Google</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>Why?</h3>
          <div class="yes">
            <h4>Hire Me...</h4>
            <p>If you're a rad boss who doesn't believe in micromanaging the shit out of employees. If you want to do that, you should be a supervisor at United Health. Hire me if you like to have fun at work. I'll bring something new and exciting to every day, unless I was up late watching the Eagles crush the Bears, then don't expect much from me. Hire me if you trust that I'll show up, mostly on time, do my tasks, nearly perfect I might add, have fun while doing those tasks, and then see who wants to join me for happy hour. I'm full of wonderful ideas that are just waiting to be let into the open. I get along with most everyone, except really stupid people. I'm not talking about people who don't have the book smarts, they're fine. They can learn. I'm talking about people who are just dumb. They say dumb things, ask dumb questions, and do dumb things. Maybe annoying is a better word for dumb... yeah, thats it.. Annoying people...</p>
          </div>
          <div class="no">
            <h4>Or Don't...</h4>
            <p>If you think having a beer while I hammer out some fantastic code is unaccepable, then don't hire me. If you fell like hovering over my shoulder while I work and freaking out if I take a couple minutes to check facebook or a sports score, don't hire me. I'm sort of blunt. If you'll be offended when I question ways of doing things or when I don't sugar-coat an issue, don't hire me.</p>
